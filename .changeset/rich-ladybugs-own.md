Changed `setAbstractFetchFunc` to accept a `fetch` API instead of one based on `NormalizedRequest` and `NormalizedResponse`.

With this change, we can return a `Response` object for requests with the upcoming clients, which can help make the interface for requests more familiar to users.

For more information and examples, see the [migration guide to v9](/packages/shopify-api/docs/migrating-to-v9.md#changes-to-runtime-adapters).
